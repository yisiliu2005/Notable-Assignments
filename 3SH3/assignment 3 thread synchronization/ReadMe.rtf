\f0\fs24 \cf0 We worked on this Assignment 3 during reading week, so we needed to meet virtually via Teams to discuss the assignment. We first had a call to think about how to approach the solution for the given scenario. Yisi came up with the idea and provided the skeleton where we could start. Each person took responsibility for one process (Yisi: Student, Jinny: TA), and we each wrote the corresponding process code. In the middle, we figured out that what we initially thought (bounded buffer) wouldn\'92t work, so we had another Teams call and Yisi suggested a new approach. After we both took time to write the code, we met again on Teams to write the main function, see if they synchronized together, and debug any errors. Yisi shared her screen, and we spotted any errors and checked if the outputs were coming up correctly. Yisi wrote the main function. Jinny wrote this ReadMe.  }
