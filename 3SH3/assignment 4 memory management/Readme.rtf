\f0\fs24 \cf0 Yisi first scrutinized the assignment requirements and suggested an approach for dividing our work. She explained the work overview. Yisi was responsible for establishing the fundamental framework for memory management, providing the core code, establishing the Paging and FIFO data structures, the initial page_in logic, and the main function. With her code, Jinny then focused on integrating the TLB functionality, writing the search_TLB, TLB_Add, and TLB_Update functions, as well as tracking the required performance statistics. After Jinny completed her task, we could compile the file and get the output. We compared the output with the given output.txt to ensure we got the correct output, and we made sure both of us got the same output from each virtual machine.    }
