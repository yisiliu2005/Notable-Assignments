\f0\fs24 \cf0 Most of the time, we worked together in the same space.\
Yisi first fully understood Assignment 2 and shared her ideas on how we could approach the solution. She wrote the C program that accepts user commands and executes each command in a separate process. Yisi also suggested building a mechanism to implement command history and actively debugged any errors.\
Jinny implemented the history function and developed the !! feature so that the most recent command could be executed again and also stored back into history. Jinny also wrote the README file. We needed to store our data so to do that, we took the queue implementation from the internet and then modified it.  }
